# My First and Simple Git Repository
This is my first attempt to create a Git repository in GitHub.
The goal here is to learn how to create and maintain a repository. 
I am interested in (amongst other things):
- Creating a branch.
- Working on the branch and committing my chnages.
- Merging the branch to main.
